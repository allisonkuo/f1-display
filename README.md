# f1-display
Creating a Formula 1 themed kiosk-like display to be used primarily (at least for now) for race reminders and countdowns.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
First, create a virtual environment for the Flask project:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
This should trigger your IDE to automatically activate the necessary extensions and the virtual environment. If your IDE doesnâ€™t do it automatically, open a terminal within the IDE and run `source venv/bin/activate` to manually activate the virtual environment.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

We use the [`concurrently`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) package to run both Flask and Next.js development servers simultaneously. 


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
Open [http://localhost:3000/api/healthcheck](http://localhost:3000/api/healthcheck) to verify that the Flask server is up and running.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
